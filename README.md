# terraform-basics

## This repository contains all the needed basics to start using terraform
---
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.
Key Features of Terraform

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
        Terraform allows the infrastructure to be described and managed using code. This enables version control, sharing, and collaboration, similar to how software code is managed.

    Declarative Configuration:
        Users describe the desired state of the infrastructure, and Terraform takes care of the steps to achieve that state. This approach simplifies the process of managing complex environments.

    Provider Ecosystem:
        Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and other services (Kubernetes, GitHub). This allows a single tool to manage infrastructure across multiple environments.

    Execution Plans:
        Terraform generates an execution plan that shows what actions will be taken to achieve the desired state. This helps in understanding the changes and prevents unexpected results.

    Resource Graph:
        It builds a graph of all resources and parallelizes the creation and destruction of non-dependent resources, which speeds up the process.

    State Management:
        Terraform keeps track of the state of the infrastructure, which helps in determining the actions needed to achieve the desired configuration.

### Why Companies Need Terraform

    Consistency and Repeatability:
        Infrastructure as code ensures that the same configuration can be applied in multiple environments (development, staging, production) consistently.

    Version Control:
        Infrastructure configurations can be version-controlled, enabling tracking of changes, rollbacks, and collaboration among team members.

    Scalability:
        Managing infrastructure at scale manually can be error-prone and time-consuming. Terraform automates these tasks, making it easier to scale up or down.

    Cost Management:
        By automating infrastructure provisioning and de-provisioning, Terraform helps in optimizing resource usage and reducing costs.

    Disaster Recovery:
        Terraform configurations can be used to quickly recreate infrastructure in case of a disaster, improving resilience and recovery times.

### Why Companies Adopt Terraform

    Multi-Cloud Strategy:
        Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, allowing companies to adopt a multi-cloud strategy without being locked into a single provider.

    Automation:
        Terraform integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, enabling continuous delivery and automated deployment of infrastructure.

    Community and Ecosystem:
        Terraform has a large and active community, which contributes to a rich ecosystem of modules, plugins, and best practices.

    Flexibility and Extensibility:
        Terraform's plugin architecture allows for extending its capabilities and integrating with other tools and services.

    Reduced Human Error:
        Automating infrastructure management reduces the risk of human error, leading to more reliable and stable environments.

By adopting Terraform, companies can achieve greater agility, efficiency, and reliability in managing their infrastructure, which is crucial for modern IT environments.

### There are 4 basic and imp commands of terraform
---
terraform init:    command initializes a Terraform working directory by performing the following tasks:

    Downloads Provider Plugins: Fetches necessary provider plugins to interact with cloud services.
    Initializes Backend: Sets up the remote backend for storing the Terraform state file.
    Installs Modules: Downloads any modules referenced in the configuration.
    Prepares Directory: Sets up the local working directory with necessary files.

In essence, terraform init prepares your environment to manage infrastructure with Terraform.

terraform plan:   command is used to create an execution plan for Terraform. It does the following:

    Reads Current State: Loads the current state of the infrastructure.
    Evaluates Configuration: Compares the current state with the desired state defined in the configuration files.
    Generates a Plan: Outputs a detailed plan showing the changes that Terraform will make to reach the desired state (e.g., creating, updating, or destroying resources).

This command helps you review the potential changes before applying them, ensuring you understand what Terraform will do.

terraform apply:   command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan to create, update, or delete infrastructure resources. Hereâ€™s what it does:

    Reads Configuration Files: Reads the configuration files to understand the desired state of the infrastructure.
    Generates and Executes Plan: If a plan is not provided, it generates one. Then it proceeds to apply the changes specified in the plan.
    Updates State: After making the changes, it updates the state file to reflect the current state of the infrastructure.

In essence, terraform apply makes the actual changes to your infrastructure as defined by your Terraform configuration
---
### In Terraform, the symbols +, -, and +/- in the plan output mean:

    + (Add): A new resource will be created.
    - (Destroy): An existing resource will be destroyed.
    +/- (Replace): An existing resource will be replaced, meaning it will be destroyed and then recreated.

#### when to user varialbes in quotes and $ notations
Whenever your variable is enclosed in a set of string or between a sentance, then we have to enclose them in strings and with bash notation.data 
Strings are supposed to be enclosed to be in double quotes while numbers and booleans doent need any type of quotes.

## varaible Precedence In Terraform
Variable precedence in Terraform is the order in which Terraform evaluates and applies variables from different sources12. The order of precedence is from the highest to lowest priority32:
    CLI arguments (-var and -var-file CLI parameters)32
    Environment variables1245
    *.auto.tfvars files312
    Terraform.tfvars file12
    shell based varibles

## Atrribute and Arguments

Arguments :  properties of the resource that to like to define as part of creation. ex: instance_type,ami etc

Atributes : they are the properties of the machine that would be comming up post the creation of the resources. 
ex: public_ip, private_ip, public_dns, arn etc.

## How authentication to aws cloud is happening from workstation
Workstation is authentication is via IAM roles attached to the WKS

## What will happen when there is change in the code? Ist is goint ot destry and create the infra or just upsates the changes as defined in the code.
---
Example: 
    Did a change in the tag name, terraform upated the name of the instance without any disruption
    Did a change in instance type, terraform shutdow the instance and updated and started (disruptive)
    Did a change of AMI, old instance terminated/destroy and new recreated

Based on the type of change that you make, terraform is goint to act accordingly, that means based on the type of change it can be disruptive or non-disruptive

---

## What will happen if you change any of the properties of the instance manully that was provisioned wiht teraform??
Then terraform considers that as a DRIFT.
Drift means change in the configurtion that what terraform has created!!
Teraform considers the properties that are mmenstioned in the code as a source of truth and will vanish the change that are done mannually.

## Datasource
Datasource in terraform helps you fecth the information of the already existing resources.
These datasources are also specific to the resources and you need to get the information from the terraform documentation.

## What is terraform state file?
The Terraform state file is a JSON-formated file that keeps track of the resources managed by Terrafrom and their current state in the target infrastructure

## What will happen if you lose the stefile?
That can be refered as a catastrophe and that is not at all acceptable.
This means that terrafro lost track of all the infra changes made or created by it.

## What is the best strategy to store or host statefile? and what is backend in terrafrom
---
1. it prefered to store the statefile in a storage centrally accesible ex. s3 bucket
2. And Enable version to the backend
3. Enable Encription to the backend
A backend defiens where terraform stores its  state data file.
---

### Modules sources in terraform
---
1. s3 bucket
2. github  (Keeping modules remote is quite mature thing)
3. local modules
4. Terraform Registry modules
---

### How can we pass the outputs from one module to other in terraform
--
In Terraform, by defaulty you cannot pass the outputs from one module to another directly.  it should be only through ROOT module only.
--

## Provisioners in terraform
In Terraform, "provisioners" are used to execute scripts or certain tasks or commands on a local or remote machine as part of the resource creation process. 

Provisioners is a sub-block in resource.
Resource attributes can be used inside provisioner and those should be referred as self.<attribute>
Provisioners by default are create-time-provisioners 
we can make multiple provisioners and provisioner types also in the same resource.

There are several types of provisioners in Terraform:

    1. local-exec: Executes a command locally on the machine running Terraform.
    2. remote-exec: Executes a command on a remote machine, usually the machine created by the Terraform resource.
    3. file: Copies files from the machine running Terraform to the remote machine.
    Example:
    provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.private_ip} > ip_address.txt"
  }

  ## Provisioners placement..
  ---
  If you place a provisioner within the resource, and if the provisioner fails because of any reason, terraform conder the entire resouce ceration itself as a failure and marks the created object as tained and that means on next Terraform Apply Object will be destroyed and re-created.

  So, its always recommended to keep the provisioners outside the Resource.

  But provisioners should always be kept with in the resource only..

  Thats why there is a null resouces, which creates nothing and thats main intention is to run provisioners.


## What are the points to be considered while designing and creating a network?
1. Understand the business need of the network
2. Analyse the number of IP address needed.
3. Understand how many subnets are needed.
4. Conclude how many subnets need access to internet and how many dont
5. Select a CIDR range either Class-A or B(10 or 172 series)
6. Ensuer the selected CIDR range is not confilicting with any of your existing AWS accounts in your project.

## Four our roboshop projects, how many IP'S do i need?

DEV : 256 : 10.0.0.0/24
PROD:1024 : 10.1.0.0/22

## what is Public and Private subnet?
Both of them are pieces from a network, but the major difference is that in puclic IP address.
In public subnet, all the machines that are lauched will have a public ip address by default and will have direct access to internet
In private subnets, all that machines that are launched will only have private ip address and no public ip address, that means we cannot connect these machine to internet.

So in our project, what all machines should be in privte network.
Aprart from frontend all other machines to be on private network..
